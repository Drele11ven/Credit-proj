# Html & Css Finance Web Page
This is an index page about investing your capital in blockchain. This page is designed only with Bootstrap Studio, without any additional code. It was a fun and challenging experience for me, and I'm glad I could push myself to create this page using a GUI developing IDE.

While I didn't complete the entire project, I'm happy to share my work and encourage others to contribute and add comments to improve it.
